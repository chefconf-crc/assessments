* cookbook fails 151/230 tests
* cookbook cannot converge with docker, hangs on "waiting for ssh" for all but ubuntu-1404
* ubuntu-1404 fails to converge due to failure to start service
* unable to `chef bundle install` as requitred gems depend on ruby 2.2.2
* the majority of issues in this cookbook are long running and not solvable within the 1hr limit in class.
